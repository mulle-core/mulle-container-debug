## Info

This repository is home to the various `describe` functions of mulle-container.
Currently there is only one data structure supported and that is
`mulle-pointerarray`. Support for the other data structures is just a matter
of time.

> #### Why is this in mulle-core ?
>
> It's based on mulle-buffer and mulle-sprintf. As mulle-sprintf uses mulle-thread,
> this repository doesn't belong in mulle-c. The describe methods are super simple
> to implement with mulle_buffer_sprintf though.
